# Atlas Runbooks

Repeatable procedures for common tasks. Read the relevant runbook BEFORE starting any job.

## Available Runbooks

| Runbook | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **building-submission.md** | Submitting buildings to Architecture Helper |
| **pinterest-pin-creation.md** | Creating and posting Pinterest pins |
| **cre-product-enrichment.md** | Enriching CRE software directory products |
| **city-guide-pipeline.md** | Adding a new city end-to-end |
| **dashboard-updates.md** | Updating the Atlas dashboard |
| **browser-automation.md** | Any task requiring headless browser |

## Rules
1. **Read before doing** — every sub-agent should read the relevant runbook
2. **Update after learning** — if you discover a new pitfall, add it to the runbook
3. **Be specific** — include exact refs, field names, selectors, wait times
4. **Include examples** — future-you is starting from scratch every session
