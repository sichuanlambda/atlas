# Plotzy Marketing Action Plan

## The 7 Answers (Dan Kulkov Framework)

1. **Problem:** CRE professionals waste hours/days manually researching zoning, parcels, and development feasibility
2. **Audience:** Mid-market CRE developers and investors who don't have CoStar-level budgets
3. **Current solution:** Manual county website lookups, paying attorneys $500+/hr, CoStar ($300-1000/mo)
4. **Good/bad about alternatives:** CoStar is comprehensive but expensive and overkill for small shops. Manual lookup works but wastes 2-5 hours per parcel.
5. **How Plotzy is better:** Instant zoning lookup, fraction of the cost, focused on what developers actually need (not everything)
6. **No-brainer pricing:** $49/mo for basic zoning lookups. Free tier with limited queries to get people hooked.
7. **First 10 customers:** Cold DMs to CRE developers on LinkedIn who post about zoning/development pain points

- DM: short, genuine, offer free zoning report for their next parcel
- Goal: 10 conversations, 5 free reports, 3 testimonials

### Content (Ongoing)
- Blog posts targeting purchase-intent keywords:
  - "How to check zoning for commercial property"
  - "Zoning due diligence checklist"
  - "[City] zoning map" (for each of our 10 cities)
  - "What does [zone code] mean" (programmatic pages from our data)
- LinkedIn posts from Nathan: personal story, CRE pain points, building in public

### Landing Page Audit
Apply Dan's rules to plotzy.ai:
- Headline: pain-focused ("Stop guessing on zoning. Know in seconds.")
- Show the product working (screenshot/video of zoning lookup)
- Social proof: testimonials from beta users
- Pricing: clear, simple, no "contact us"
- CTA: "Try free lookup" (not "sign up")

## Don't Do Yet
- Paid ads (landing page needs optimization first)
- Newsletter sponsorships (expensive, wrong stage)
- Referral program (need stable conversion first)
- SEO blog posts about generic topics ("what is CRE" — too far from purchase)
