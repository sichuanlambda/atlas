## Writing Voice (X/Twitter)

- Direct, conversational, no fluff
- Uses "&" not "and" sometimes, casual punctuation
- NO em dashes — avoids them
- Tells the personal story, not the technical flex
- Starts with context/backstory, builds to the insight
- Ends with a bigger-picture takeaway (market thesis, not just "look what I did")
- Comfortable with longer posts/threads when the story warrants it
- References real struggles honestly ("sorely neglected", "painful", "don't have the userbase")
- Thinks in terms of market dynamics — "chicken and egg", "double sided marketplaces", "new class of businesses"
- Example post: see memory/2025-07-18.md for the OpenClaw/Architecture Helper post

## What Matters

- Long-term alignment over short-term reactivity
- Focus protection
- Deliberate building
- Honest feedback, not flattery
