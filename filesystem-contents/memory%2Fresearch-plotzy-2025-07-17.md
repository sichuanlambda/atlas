- **Pricing:** Free tier available, managed services at premium
- **Note:** There may be a *different* Swizzel entity connected to Nathan. The swizzel.com found is an AI marketing platform — unclear if this is the right entity. Need clarification from Atlas on which Swizzel is meant.

- **Focus:** NGO/nonprofit sector — fundraising tools, compliance management, donor CRM

## 4. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (AI-powered parcel/zoning search)

| Company | What They Do | Differentiation |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Regrid (formerly Loveland Technologies)** | Nationwide parcel data platform, APIs, boundary data | Largest parcel dataset in US; API-first; more data infrastructure than end-user tool |
| **LandGlide** | Mobile parcel data app | Consumer-friendly; mobile-first; less AI, more lookup tool |
| **Reonomy** | CRE property intelligence platform | Larger/funded; broader CRE intel (ownership, debt, sales comps); enterprise pricing |
| **CoStar / LoopNet** | CRE data and marketplace giant | Market leader; massive dataset; very expensive; not AI-native for zoning |
| **LandVision (by Digital Map Products)** | Site selection and property research | Enterprise GIS; used by large developers; heavy/complex |
| **ATTOM Data** | Property data provider | Data-as-a-service; not an end-user search tool |
| **Cherre** | Real estate data integration platform | Enterprise data unification; not direct competitor at SMB level |
| **Deepblocks** | AI-powered feasibility analysis for CRE development | Focuses on development feasibility/financial modeling, not parcel search |
| **Zoneomics** | Zoning data and analytics | Most directly comparable on zoning; maps zoning codes across municipalities |
| **ParcelQuest** | California-focused parcel/property data | Regional; traditional data provider |

### Plotzy's Positioning & Differentiation
1. **AI-native zoning answers** — Most competitors provide raw zoning codes; Plotzy interprets them with AI and gives natural-language answers with source citations
2. **Integrated workflow** — Search → Research → Owner Contact → List Management in one tool (vs. using 3-4 separate tools)
3. **Price point** — $65-200/mo is significantly cheaper than Reonomy ($500+/mo), CoStar ($thousands/mo), or LandVision (enterprise)
4. **SMB/individual focus** — Targets individual brokers and small teams, not just enterprise
5. **Municipality-level zoning depth** — Going deep on specific municipalities rather than thin nationwide coverage

### Where Plotzy Is NOT Yet Differentiated
- **Data coverage** — "Select municipalities" limitation is a major constraint vs. nationwide competitors
- **Brand recognition** — Very early stage; no significant press or community buzz
- **Funding** — No known venture funding vs. heavily funded competitors (Reonomy raised $128M, CoStar is publicly traded)
- **Team size** — Appears to be a very small team

### Market Size Signals
- US commercial real estate market: **~$21 trillion** in total asset value
- CRE technology market: estimated **$15-25B** and growing ~12% CAGR
- PropTech investment: **$19.8B** in 2024 (per KPMG/various)
- ~200,000+ commercial real estate brokers in the US (NAR data)
- Parcel data market specifically: growing as municipalities digitize records
- Zoning complexity increasing → more demand for AI interpretation tools
- Key trend: CRE professionals spending 30-40% of time on research that could be automated

## 5. Summary & Strategic Observations

### Strengths
- Clear product-market fit signal: solves a real pain point (zoning research is tedious and error-prone)
- Founder has relevant industry experience (Keller Williams)
- AI-native approach in a market dominated by legacy data providers
- Accessible pricing for individual practitioners

### Weaknesses / Risks
- Very early stage with limited geographic coverage
- No visible funding or team depth
- Competitive moat unclear — larger players could add AI features
- Light public footprint (no PR, no Product Hunt, minimal social proof)

### Opportunities
- Zoning AI is a genuine whitespace — no major player owns this
- Municipality-by-municipality expansion creates defensible local data
- Partnership potential with brokerages, title companies
- Custom solutions arm could fund growth

### Key Unknowns (Needs Manual Research)
1. Nathan's Twitter activity — what he's building publicly, who he engages with
2. Nathan's exact roles at Swizzel and Givo — need LinkedIn or direct confirmation
3. Funding status — bootstrapped vs. raised?
4. Team size and composition
5. Customer traction / revenue indicators
6. Product Hunt launch plans
