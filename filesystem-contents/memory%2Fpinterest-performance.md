### Patterns Observed

**Too early for definitive conclusions** — pins are only 1-3 days old. But early signals:

1. **Cross-posting to style boards helps:** Pontalba (cross-posted to Victorian) has 2x the impressions of Cathedral (not cross-posted), despite being posted later. Victorian board appears to drive discovery.

2. **Buildings with story/drama get clicks:** Saenger Theatre (Hurricane Katrina restoration story) and Pontalba Buildings (historic significance) got the most pin clicks. Descriptions with narrative hooks outperform factual-only descriptions.

3. **Age matters most right now:** Clear correlation between pin age and impressions (older = more). Need 7-14 days before comparing fairly.

4. **Save rate is solid at 9.3%:** Industry average is ~2-5%. Every pin got at least 1 save, suggesting the content resonates with the architecture audience.

5. **Outbound clicks are low (1 total):** The "Visit site" CTA isn't compelling enough. May need stronger call-to-action in descriptions.

### Template Assessment

**v1 template** (current): `{building_name} | {primary_style} Architecture in {city}`
- Working reasonably well for a new account
- No template change warranted yet — need more data (next review in 3 days)

### Action Items for Next Review
- [ ] Compare performance after pins have 7+ days of data
- [ ] Test whether cross-posting to style boards consistently outperforms single-board pins
- [ ] Consider adding stronger CTA language to boost outbound clicks
- [ ] Watch if Victorian board continues to outperform other style boards
