# Marketing Framework — Distilled from Dan Kulkov's Solopreneur Guide

Source: Dan Kulkov (FounderPal). Nathan shared this Feb 19, 2026.

## Core Principles

### 1. Painkiller > Vitamin
- Painkillers: boring-sounding, major consequences if unsolved, B2B, daily use
- Vitamins: hype-sounding, minor consequences, B2C, annual use
- **Plotzy = painkiller** (zoning lookup saves hours/days, prevents costly mistakes)
- **Architecture Helper = vitamin** (interesting but not pain-solving) — needs repositioning or acceptance as content/SEO play
- **CRE Software directory = vitamin leaning painkiller** (saves research time when buying software)

### 2. Strategy Before Tactics (7 Questions)
For each product, answer:
1. What one problem am I solving?
2. What audience segment craves this the most?
3. What's the current go-to solution?
4. What's good and bad about it?
5. How is my product better?
6. What pricing is a no-brainer?
7. How will I get my first 10 customers?

### 3. Channel Mix (Not Just Twitter/PH)
**Getting first customers:**
- Social media where audience hangs out (LinkedIn for CRE!)
- Cold outreach/DMs (manual, genuine, offer free access for feedback)
- Product Hunt launch
- Email list pre-launch

**Scaling after launch:**
- Free tools for SEO (Plotzy Labs idea = this exactly)
- Programmatic SEO (data-driven pages, not AI spam)
- Facebook retargeting ads (once funnel is solid)
- Long-tail blog posts near purchase intent
- Affiliate marketing (once conversion is stable)

**Avoid:**
- Newsletter sponsorships (expensive, bot clicks)
- Google Ads (expensive, irrelevant clicks)
- Twitter Ads (worst targeting)
- Reddit audience building (ban risk — but answering long-tail questions works)

### 4. Landing Page Rules
- Page is about what CUSTOMERS get, not about the product
- "You/your" not "we/our"
- Emotional heading + rational explanation structure
- Good product visuals that make people want to try it
- Social proof everywhere
- 3-5 feature bullets max (people won't remember more)
- 3-4 colors only
- No animations
- No desperation ("EARLY BIRD PLEASE")
- Don't call yourself "the best"
- Talk to 30 people who haven't seen it (worst 15 minutes, best feedback)

### 5. Marketing Copy Formula
- **Open with emotion/promise:** "Ship faster", "Never miss a zoning change"
- **Follow with rational explanation:** what the product actually does
- **Mix in:** stories, testimonials, specific numbers
- **Avoid:** superlatives, "streamline/supercharge", 5+ bullet feature lists, "we" focus

### 6. SEO Approach
- Content: blog posts + free tools + marketing pages (need all 3)
- **Free tools first** (easy to build, easier to rank, natural product promotion)
- Keyword research: find what audience ALREADY searches for
- Content without backlinks = invisible
- Backlinks from: directory launches, free tools so good media links to them, embedded on customer sites
- Don't do SEO before first customer (takes months, pivot risk)

### 7. Email Marketing Sequence
1. Free tool collects emails (no gatekeeping, email for extra value)
2. Sequence for new emails: freebie + promote paid product
3. Sequence for signups: onboarding, founder story, testimonials, discounts
4. Sequence for purchasers: thank you, feature requests, upsell
5. Weekly/monthly newsletter to all

### 8. Weekly Framework
Each week, pick ONE goal:
- **Sharpen positioning:** talk to customers, analyze competitors, polish copy, build features
- **Get more visitors:** content, free tools, ads, emails, partnerships
- **Increase conversion:** fix landing page, write emails, get testimonials, experiment pricing

## Application to Our Products

### Plotzy (Priority)
- **Painkiller status:** YES — zoning verification prevents costly dev mistakes
- **Audience:** CRE developers, brokers, investors on LinkedIn
- **First 10 customers:** Cold DMs to CRE developers on LinkedIn, offer free zoning reports
- **Free tools play:** Plotzy Labs (cap rate calc, zoning lookup, NOI calc) = lead magnets + SEO
- **Landing page:** Focus on pain ("Stop wasting weeks on parcels that can't be rezoned")

### Architecture Helper
- **Vitamin status:** Accept it — this is a content/SEO brand, not a SaaS painkiller
- **Channel:** Pinterest (working), programmatic SEO (style pages, city guides)
- **Monetization:** Affiliate links, premium content, lead gen to architects/firms
- **Don't try to make it a painkiller** — lean into what it is

### CRE Software Directory
- **Near-painkiller:** Saves real time when evaluating CRE software purchases
- **SEO play:** Programmatic pages for "[product] review", "[product] pricing", "[product] alternatives"
- **Monetization path:** Affiliate/referral fees from vendors, sponsored listings
- **First revenue:** Add "request demo" buttons that route to vendors (track referrals)
