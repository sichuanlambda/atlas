New Orleans has the most architecturally diverse square mile in America.

I just published a free guide to 14 buildings across 8 styles — from 1794 to today.

🏛️ St. Louis Cathedral (1794)

The oldest cathedral in continuous use in the US — and it's more Spanish than French. Both fires in the 1780s-90s destroyed the French original. The Spanish rebuilt it with thicker walls and a more dramatic facade.

🏚️ The shotgun house is NOLA's greatest architectural invention.

No hallways. Rooms in a straight line. Roots in West African and Haitian building traditions. Perfectly adapted to the city's narrow lots and brutal heat.

This one's at 2726 Constance St in the Irish Channel.

🎭 Saenger Theatre (1927)

The interior recreates a starlit Italian courtyard — clouds actually drift across the ceiling. Architect Emile Weil designed it as an "atmospheric theater."

It was devastated by Katrina and took 8 years to restore.

🏡 Pitot House (1799) — hidden gem on Bayou St. John

The only French Colonial Creole house open to the public in NOLA. Wide galleries, raised foundation, West Indian influence. Named after the city's first American mayor.

Most tourists never make it here. Locals know.

🏗️ Pontalba Buildings (1851)

The oldest apartments in America. Built by Baroness Pontalba, who introduced cast-iron galleries to New Orleans — now the city's most iconic architectural feature.

Her monogram (AP) is still in the ironwork on Jackson Square.
