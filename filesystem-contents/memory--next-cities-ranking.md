### Honorable mentions (just outside top 10)
- **Seattle** (31.5) — decent but not an architecture destination
- **Portland OR** (30.5) — limited landmark density
- **Austin** (28.0) — thin architectural scene

## Recommended Expansion Order

### Wave 1 (Next 3 cities — high impact)
1. **Washington DC** — Massive image pool (1.6M Commons), strong tourism (20M+/yr), neoclassical/Brutalist/modern diversity. SEO gap: most guides focus on monuments, not architecture. HABS coverage is extraordinary.
2. **Philadelphia** — Underrated architectural powerhouse. Colonial/Federal/Art Deco/Brutalist. PSFS Building (first International Style skyscraper in US). Strong SEO gap — few dedicated architecture guides. 600+ HABS records.
3. **Boston** — Colonial, Federal, Richardsonian Romanesque (Trinity Church), Back Bay Victorian, Brutalist City Hall. 115K Commons images. Strong New England representation.

### Wave 2 (Next 3 — niche + diversity)
4. **Los Angeles** — Case Study Houses, Googie, Spanish Colonial Revival, Mid-Century Modern, Disney Hall. Huge tourism but sprawling. Competitive SEO but massive traffic ceiling.
5. **Detroit** — Best narrative hook ("ruin porn to renaissance"). Guardian Building, Michigan Central, Fisher Building. Very underserved online. Growing architecture tourism niche.
6. **Savannah** — Unique Oglethorpe square plan. Federal, Greek Revival, Victorian, Gothic. Very underserved. 200+ HABS records. Niche but passionate audience.

### Wave 3 (Remaining 4 — long tail)
7. **Miami** — Art Deco Historic District, MiMo. Architecturally narrower but world-famous style district.
8. **Charleston** — Similar appeal to Savannah. Rainbow Row, antebellum, single houses. 400+ HABS records.
9. **Pittsburgh** — H.H. Richardson, Fallingwater nearby, Steel-era industrial. Limited tourism draw.
10. **Nashville** — Growing city, Parthenon replica, but architecture not primary draw.

## Key Insight
The biggest SEO gaps are in Tier 2 cities (Detroit, Savannah, Charleston, Philadelphia) where search demand exists but quality architecture-specific content doesn't. DC and Boston have higher absolute traffic but more competition. The sweet spot is Philadelphia — large city, rich architecture, surprisingly underserved.
