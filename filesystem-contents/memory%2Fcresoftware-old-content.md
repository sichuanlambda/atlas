## Old nav categories
- Residential, Development, Law & Municipal, Search & Site Selection, Construction

## Old submit tool
- Was using Tally: https://tally.so/r/m6vMWN

## Content quality assessment
- CRM page was the most substantial (~2000+ words)
- Most other pages were 200-500 words of generic SEO text
- No specific tool mentions or comparisons within category content
- Decision: Generate fresh, higher-quality editorial content rather than reusing old text

## Old site was Unicorn Platform hosted
- Categories were different from current: more vertical/use-case based vs current functional categories
