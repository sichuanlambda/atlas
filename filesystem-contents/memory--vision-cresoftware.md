# CRESoftware.tech — Vision Document
*Last updated: 2026-02-18*

## Vision Statement

CRESoftware.tech becomes the definitive buying guide for commercial real estate technology — G2 for CRE. When any broker, asset manager, developer, or property manager Googles "best [category] software for commercial real estate," we own that result. We become the place where CRE professionals make software decisions, and where vendors need to be listed to get deals.

## Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Products listed | 174 |
| Categories | 14 |
| Data quality | All enriched with real data |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages (static) |
| Editorial | Category pages with FAQ |
| SEO infra | In place |
| Lead gen | Submit form only |

**What's working:** We have a real, enriched dataset that nobody else has assembled for CRE specifically. Static site = zero hosting cost, fast pages, good Core Web Vitals. Category pages with editorial content are the right SEO play.

**What's not working yet:** No reviews (the core value prop of a directory). No vendor engagement. No revenue. No traffic data suggests we're ranking yet. The dataset exists but isn't generating inbound.

## Product Roadmap

### Months 1–3: SEO Machine + Review Foundation

**The only thing that matters right now is ranking for CRE software queries.**

1. **Long-tail content blitz** — Write 14 buyer's guides, one per category. "Best Property Management Software for Commercial Real Estate (2026)." "Best CRE Investment Analysis Tools Compared." These are money pages. Each one targets a buying-intent keyword. Format: top 5 picks, comparison table, pros/cons, pricing, FAQ.
2. **Product comparison pages** — "[Product A] vs [Product B]" pages for the top 3 products in each category. These rank for high-intent queries. 14 categories × 3 comparisons = 42 new pages. Programmatic generation with manual editorial polish.
3. **Basic review system** — Even 1–2 reviews per product transforms credibility. Start with a simple form: rating (1–5), role, company size, pros, cons, one-liner. No login required initially (reduces friction). Moderate manually. Seed with outreach to CRE professionals you know.
4. **Schema markup** — Product schema, Review schema, FAQ schema on every page. This is table stakes for search visibility in the software category.

### Months 3–6: Vendor Engagement + Lead Gen

5. **"Claim Your Profile" flow** — Let vendors claim their listing. Free tier: update description, add logo, link to site. This gets vendors invested in the platform and gives you a sales conversation opener.
6. **Lead gen infrastructure** — "Get a Demo" or "Request Pricing" buttons on every product page. Capture the lead (name, email, company, company size). Route to vendor. This is the revenue engine.
7. **Newsletter** — "CRE Tech Weekly" — new products, category trends, funding news. CRE professionals are underserved by tech content. Build an owned audience. Target: 500 subscribers by month 6.
8. **Pricing intelligence** — Add pricing tiers/ranges for every product. CRE buyers care enormously about pricing and it's nearly impossible to find. Even approximate ranges are valuable. This becomes a moat.

### Months 6–12: Platform + Revenue

9. **"Stack" feature** — "What tools does your firm use?" Users share their CRE tech stack by firm type and size. This is pure gold for buyers ("firms like mine use X") and for vendors (competitive intelligence). Also generates unique, defensible content.
10. **Integration maps** — Visual map of which products integrate with which. CRE firms care deeply about this because their workflows span deal management → underwriting → asset management → accounting. Nobody maps this.
11. **Vendor profiles (paid tier)** — Enhanced listings: case studies, video demos, custom badges, priority placement. $200–500/month per vendor.
12. **Comparison tool** — Side-by-side comparison of up to 3 products with feature matrix. Interactive, saves as PDF. High utility, high engagement.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: 0 → 5K monthly visitors (Months 1–4)

**SEO (60% of effort)**
- 14 buyer's guide pages targeting "[category] software commercial real estate"
- 42 comparison pages targeting "[product] vs [product] CRE"
- 174 product pages (already exist) targeting "[product name] reviews commercial real estate"
- FAQ content targeting question queries ("what software do commercial real estate brokers use")
- Total rankable URLs: 230+. Each one a long-tail magnet.
- CRE software is a low-competition, high-value niche. These queries have low search volume individually (50–500/month) but high buying intent and low competition. We can rank.

**LinkedIn (25% of effort)**
- CRE professionals live on LinkedIn. Period.
- Post 3x/week: category comparisons, "tool of the week" spotlights, CRE tech trends.
- Engage in CRE-focused LinkedIn groups. Comment on PropTech posts.
- Connect directly with CRE tech buyers (VP of Operations at major brokerages, CTO/CIO at REITs).
- Target: 1K LinkedIn followers, 50K post impressions/month by month 4.

**Direct outreach to vendors (15% of effort)**
- Email every vendor: "Your product is listed on CRESoftware.tech. Claim your profile."
- This does two things: gets vendors linking to us (backlinks!) and starts the sales conversation.
- Target: 30 vendors claimed by month 4.

### Phase 2: 5K → 25K monthly visitors (Months 4–8)

- **Content marketing** — Monthly "State of CRE Tech" report. Category deep-dives. Interview series with CRE tech buyers. This builds authority and backlinks.
- **PropTech events** — Attend/sponsor CREtech, MIPIM, Blueprint. These are where buyers and vendors meet. Have a presence, even if just a booth card that says "find your CRE tech stack."
- **CRE association partnerships** — NAIOP, ICSC, BOMA, ULI. Offer member discounts or co-branded content. These associations need tech education content for members.
- **Backlink campaign** — CRE publications (GlobeSt, Commercial Observer, Bisnow) often need software roundups. Be their source.

### Phase 3: 25K+ monthly visitors (Months 8–12)

- **Vendor sales team** — Even if it's just you. Once you have traffic and leads flowing, vendors will pay for premium placement.
- **Webinar series** — "Choosing Your CRE Tech Stack" webinars. Co-host with a vendor (they promote to their audience, you get leads).
- **Referral/word of mouth** — At this stage, the product should be good enough that CRE professionals recommend it to each other.

## Revenue Model

**Timeline to revenue: Month 4–5 (lead gen), Month 6–7 (vendor profiles).**

| Revenue Stream | When | Price Point | Potential |
|---------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| Lead gen (demo requests) | Month 4 | $50–200/lead | $2K–10K/month at 5K visitors |
| Vendor claimed profiles (paid) | Month 7 | $200–500/month | $5K–20K/month at 30–50 paying vendors |
| Sponsored category placement | Month 8 | $500–1K/month | $5K–10K/month |
| Affiliate (where available) | Month 3 | Varies | $500–2K/month |
| Buyer's guide sponsorship | Month 6 | $1K–3K per guide | One-time revenue per guide refresh |

**The big money is in lead gen.** CRE software deals are $10K–500K+ ACV. A qualified lead is worth $50–200 easily, sometimes more. If we send 100 leads/month at $100/lead, that's $10K/month from a static site.

**What I'm NOT doing:** Display ads. They signal "cheap directory" not "trusted buying resource." The audience is too valuable and too small for CPM-based revenue.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Coverage of CRE | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| G2 | Has CRE products but buried under general software. No CRE-specific categories or editorial. | We're CRE-native. Every category, every comparison is framed for CRE buyers. |
| Capterra | Same as G2. Generic. | Same advantage. |
| GetApp | Same tier. | Same. |
| CREtech.com | Events + news, not a directory | We're a decision tool, not a media company. |
| PropTech blogs | Scattered coverage | We're structured, comprehensive, comparable. |
| Vendor websites | Self-serving | We're independent. |

**Our moat (building over time):**
1. **CRE-specific depth** — G2 will never have "best software for 1031 exchanges" as a category. We will.
2. **Reviews from CRE professionals** — Once we have 500+ reviews from verified CRE buyers, this is extremely hard to replicate. Reviews are a network effect.
3. **Vendor relationships** — Once vendors are claiming profiles and paying, they have switching costs.
4. **SEO authority in CRE software** — First mover in a niche compounds. If we rank #1 for 200 CRE software queries, a new entrant faces years of catch-up.
5. **Integration/stack data** — If we build the "what does your firm use" dataset, that's proprietary and invaluable.

**Honest assessment:** The moat is thin today. 174 products on a static site can be replicated in a weekend. The moat builds with reviews, vendor engagement, and SEO authority — none of which exist yet. Speed matters. We need to be the established player before anyone else decides this niche is worth pursuing.
