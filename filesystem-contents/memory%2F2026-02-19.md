## Ideas List

### Plotzy Labs Page
- Nathan's idea: Build a "Plotzy Labs" page with ~12 mini apps useful for CRE professionals
- Related to Plotzy.ai — serves as lead gen, brand building, SEO magnets
- Think: zoning lookup tool, cap rate calculator, rent comp estimator, development feasibility quick-check, property tax estimator, lease vs buy calculator, NOI calculator, debt service coverage calculator, parking ratio calculator, FAR/density calculator, construction cost estimator, 1031 exchange timeline tool
- Each mini app is a standalone page that ranks for "[tool name] calculator" keywords
- Drives traffic to Plotzy, demonstrates domain expertise, captures emails
- Atlas can build 99% of these — they're static JS tools with no backend needed
- Could host at labs.plotzy.ai or plotzy.ai/labs

### Agent Configs Created
- **Scout** (agents/scout.md): CRE research & product enrichment. Persistent knowledge about which sources work/don't, product-specific quirks.
- **Mason** (agents/mason.md): Building submission. Knows the critical rules, image sources, Playwright config, city-specific notes.  
- **Scribe** (agents/scribe.md): Content & editorial. Writing style rules, content inventory, SEO patterns, templates.
- Pattern: When spawning, task instructions say "Read agents/{name}.md first" — agent picks up persistent context and updates it after the run.

### CRE Product Status
- 208 total products (174 original + 34 new)
- 66 with real features (32%)
- 142 still need enrichment — Scout running on them now
- Enriched data merged into live products.json and pushed

### Nathan Preferences (Feb 19)
- **Always include links in updates** — building pages, Place pages, CRE products, Pinterest pins. Nathan wants to spot-check. No "trust me" updates.
- **Pushback appreciated** — Nathan liked the vitamin/painkiller pushback on the book club idea. Keep being honest.
- **Marketing docs created**: framework + 3 action plans (Plotzy, AH, CRE) distilled from Dan Kulkov guide
- **Book club app**: spec'd and shelved (memory/product-bookclub.md). Low priority, build during idle time.
- **ACL fix deployed**: Nathan pulled, deployed, running rake tasks. S3 bucket doesn't allow ACLs — removed `acl: "public-read"` from all upload calls.

### Major Milestones (Feb 19, ~09:00-11:49 UTC)

**Heroku CLI Fully Working**
- Installed at /usr/local/bin/heroku (v10.17.0)
- API key stored at ~/.config/secrets/heroku.env
- Heroku remote configured with API key auth: `https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/boiling-atoll-02251.git`
- Atlas can now deploy (`git push heroku main`) and run rake tasks autonomously
- First autonomous deploy: v382 (image fallback fix)

**Image Pipeline Fixed**
- `fix_batch` ran successfully: all 7 remaining broken images uploaded to S3 (ACL error fixed by removing `acl: "public-read"`)
- `reanalyze_missing` ran: Trinity Church done, 6 others processing via Sidekiq
- Thumbnail generation started but killed by session timeout (only got to building #64 of 409)
- Thumbnail helper DISABLED for now — returns original URLs until thumbnails are fully generated
- onerror fallback added but didn't work reliably with lazy loading + S3 403s

**CRE Software Directory Upgraded**
- New logo (SVG building icon)
- Search fixed: was display:none CSS conflict, changed to display:block
- Removed "Enriched Profiles" stat and "Press / to search" hint
- Fixed white "Visit Website" buttons (now accent blue)
- Quick filters, comparison badges, stats counter, back-to-top button
- 65 enriched products merged + 34 new products added = 208 total
- Scout sub-agent running on remaining 142 unenriched products

**Dashboard Control Center v3**
- Agents org chart page added (#/agents) — Nathan/Atlas hierarchy with Research/Ops/Content/Technical teams
- Expandable "Waiting on Nathan" items with steps, links, context
- Markdown rendering in Notes tab (headers, bold, code, lists, tables)
- Edit & Save via GitHub API (one-time token setup)
- Marketing docs added to Notes file list

**Agent Configs Created**
- agents/scout.md — CRE research, persistent knowledge about sources
- agents/mason.md — Building submission, critical rules, Playwright config
- agents/scribe.md — Content writing, style rules, templates

**Marketing Docs Written**
- memory/marketing-framework.md — Dan Kulkov solopreneur guide distilled
- memory/marketing-plotzy-actions.md — Plotzy Labs free tools as SEO magnets
- memory/marketing-ah-actions.md — Pinterest + programmatic SEO
- memory/marketing-cre-actions.md — G2-style SEO play, vendor referral revenue

**Building Submission Workflow Proven**
- Nathan sends photo or X post link → Atlas identifies building, finds address, submits
- Armour-Stiner Octagon House (#1030): identified from photo, Irvington NY
- Schwerin Castle (#1031): identified from X post @dutchbuildings, extracted images via browser DOM
- Submission pattern: inject hidden fields into form DOM, click submit button

**Key Technical Learnings**
- S3 bucket blocks ACLs: remove `acl: "public-read"` from all upload_file calls
- Heroku git auth: use `https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/APP.git` as remote URL
- `heroku login -i` doesn't work without TTY, use HEROKU_API_KEY env var instead
- Thumbnail onerror fallback unreliable with lazy loading — S3 returns 403 (not 404) for missing objects
- External image URL field not in DOM on /new page — must inject via JS evaluate
- X/Twitter blocks web_fetch — use browser tool to extract tweet text and image URLs from DOM

**Nathan Preferences Captured**
- Always include links in updates for spot-checking
- Pushback appreciated (book club vitamin feedback was well received)
- Wants to be able to point to X posts or images and have Atlas add buildings
- Plotzy is core focus, everything else is proving ground
- Idea logged: "Plotzy Labs" page with ~12 mini CRE calculator tools

**Status Cron Reduced**
- Changed from hourly to 4x daily (09/13/17/21 UTC) — was burning tokens overnight with nothing to report

**Pinterest**
- Pin #10 posted (McGehee School, NOLA)
- 3-day performance review: 107 impressions, 6 clicks, 10 saves across 10 pins
- 9.3% save rate (above 2-5% industry average)
- Cross-posting to style boards doubles discovery

### Session 2 Updates (Feb 19, ~11:30-22:00 UTC)

**Boston Image Cleanup — 12 buildings fixed**
- Ran vision check on all 18 Boston building images
- 12 had wrong images (book covers, government docs, plaques, blank books)
- All 12 replaced with proper Wikimedia Commons building photos, uploaded to S3
- Wikimedia rate-limited after 10 — waited and retried last 2 successfully
- Boston Place hero image also fixed (was Wikimedia hotlink, now on S3 — Boston skyline)

**Philly Image Cleanup — 5 buildings fixed**
- #998 Free Library (was Blake painting), #1000 Barnes Foundation (was NBS doc), #1003 Betsy Ross House (was Army Corps doc), #1004 Christ Church (was plaque), #1005 Franklin Institute (was Cancer Institute report)
- All replaced with proper Wikimedia building photos on S3
- Duplicate Eastern State Penitentiary (#1011) noted but no `visible` column to hide it

**Thumbnail System Fully Disabled**
- thumbnail_url helper now just returns original URL
- onerror fallback was unreliable with lazy loading + S3 403s
- Will re-enable after full thumbnail generation completes

**Image Validation Added to Pipeline**
- Updated building-submission runbook with mandatory vision validation step
- After sourcing from Wikimedia, batch-check all images with vision tool before submitting
- Key filters: skip filenames with .pdf, .tif, plan, diagram, plaque, marker, painting, etc.

**Full Image Audit — Other Cities Clean**
- Sub-agent audited SF (868-884), NOLA (921-934), NYC (935-952), DC (954-956)
- Only issue: #953 is an accidental test upload (rendering, not a photo) — outside city ranges
- All other images verified as real building photos

**Pinterest Queue Massively Expanded**
- Added 49 new pins from SF, Chicago, NOLA, NYC, DC, Philly, standalone buildings
- Total queue: 90 pins (~22 days of content at 4/day)
- 12 pins published total by end of day

**Barcelona Pipeline Launched**
- Sub-agent spawned for full Barcelona city guide pipeline
- 16-18 buildings planned (Gaudí works, Gothic Quarter, Modernisme, Modern)
- Pipeline includes image validation step

**Content Queue System Built**
- New page in Atlas Control Center: #/content
- Unified view of all content across Pinterest (auto), X @architectrHelpr (manual), X @nathansrobinson (manual), X @plotzyai (future)
- 5 X posts ready for @architectrHelpr, 2 drafts for @nathansrobinson
- Voice profiles per account — different tone for each
- Feedback loop: Nathan pastes what he posted + screenshots analytics → Atlas learns
- File: /home/openclaw/projects/atlas/content-queue.json

**X/Twitter Access**
- Credentials saved: ~/.config/secrets/x-architecturehelper.env
- @architectrHelpr / cdnathan.robinson@gmail.com
- Headless browser login BLOCKED by X anti-bot detection (Retry dialog loop)
- X API Free tier recommended: 1,500 tweets/mo, apply at developer.x.com
- Nathan said to try X API — he'll apply when ready

**Marketing Strategy Discussion**
- Nathan wants Atlas to "earn its keep" on marketing
- Immediate actions: Reddit posts, programmatic SEO pages, CRE comparison content, X posts
- Access needed: Email/Gmail (#1), X API (#2), Google Analytics (#3), GSC API (#4), Reddit (#5), Brave Search API (#6)
- CRE affiliate play identified as fastest revenue path ($500+/mo from comparison pages)
- Nathan wants ability to give feedback on content and share analytics screenshots

**Status Cron Updates**
- Status cron running in isolated session thinks browser is blocked — doesn't see main session work
- Pinterest cron successfully posted 3 pins today (9AM, 5PM, 9PM slots)
- 1PM slot missed due to browser issues

**Heroku Runner Pattern (stable)**
- Heredoc stdin works: `heroku run -- rails runner - <<'RUBY' ... RUBY`
- Single-line inline scripts get quote-mangled — avoid
- Rate limit Wikimedia: sleep 2 between downloads, use proper User-Agent
