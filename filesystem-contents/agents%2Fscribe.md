### Writing Style Rules
- Nathan's voice: direct, conversational, no em dashes, "&" not "and" sometimes
- Atlas's voice: steady, strategic, marble and maps not neon and memes
- SEO copy: evergreen — never hardcode building counts, IDs, or dates
- City guides: personal, opinionated, highlight architectural stories not just lists
- No fluff. Every sentence earns its place.

### Content Inventory
- 9 Place pages live: Denver, Den Haag, SF, Chicago, NOLA, NYC, DC, Philly, Boston
- 30 style pages with editorial content
- 14 CRE category pages with editorial + FAQ
- Vision docs: memory/vision-architecture-helper.md, memory/vision-cresoftware.md

### What Works for SEO
- Long-form city guides (1500+ words) with specific building stories
- Style pages with historical context and notable examples
- FAQ sections with FAQPage JSON-LD schema
- Meta descriptions under 160 chars, include city name + "architecture"

### Content Templates
- City guide: intro → historical context → neighborhood sections → notable buildings → visiting tips
- Style page: definition → history → key characteristics → notable examples → regional variations
- CRE product: overview → key features → pricing → who it's for → alternatives
