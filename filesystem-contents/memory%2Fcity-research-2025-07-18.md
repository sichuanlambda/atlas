## Detailed City Notes

### Tier 1 — Strong Candidates

**New York City** — The obvious giant. Massive architectural diversity (Colonial, Federal, Beaux-Arts, Art Deco, International Style, Postmodern, contemporary). r/nyc is one of the largest city subs (~500k+). However: **extremely competitive SEO**. Dozens of existing architecture tour guides, TimeOut, Architectural Digest, AIA guides, dedicated walking tour companies. Hard to rank. High traffic ceiling but steep climb.

**Washington DC** — Enormous Commons coverage (1.6M results — likely inflated by "Washington" matching broadly, but still excellent). Neoclassical, Beaux-Arts, Brutalist (FBI HQ, HUD), modern (National Museum of African American History). Strong tourism (20M+ annual visitors). SEO competition moderate — most guides focus on monuments, not architecture specifically. Good gap opportunity for an architecture-focused guide.

**Philadelphia** — Underrated architectural powerhouse. Colonial/Federal (Independence Hall), Victorian (Rittenhouse), Art Deco (PSFS Building — first International Style skyscraper in US), Brutalist (city hall environs), contemporary (Comcast buildings). 16K Commons images. **Strong SEO gap** — fewer dedicated architecture guides than NYC/DC/Chicago. r/philadelphia is active (~400k). HABS has extensive Philadelphia coverage.

**Boston** — Colonial, Federal, Richardsonian Romanesque (Trinity Church), Back Bay Victorian, modern (City Hall — famous Brutalist). 115K Commons images. Good tourism. But: reasonably well-served by existing architecture guides (Boston Architectural College, AIA Boston, walking tours).

**New Orleans** — Highly distinctive architecture (French Colonial, Creole, Shotgun houses, Garden District mansions, Italianate, Cast-iron galleries). **Extremely recognizable and photogenic.** Strong tourism (18M+ annual). **Good SEO gap** — most guides focus on food/music/nightlife, architecture coverage is secondary. 4.8K Commons images is moderate but the HABS collection for New Orleans/Louisiana is extensive.

### Tier 2 — Solid Options

**Los Angeles** — Case Study Houses, Googie, Spanish Colonial Revival, Art Deco (Eastern Columbia), Mid-Century Modern, contemporary (Disney Hall, Broad). Huge tourism. But sprawling city makes a "guide" harder. Very competitive SEO.

**Miami** — Art Deco Historic District is world-famous. MiMo (Miami Modern). Contemporary skyline. Good tourism. But architecturally narrow compared to older cities — essentially Art Deco + Contemporary.

**Detroit** — Fascinating story: Beaux-Arts grandeur (Michigan Central, Guardian Building, Fisher Building), Art Deco, industrial ruins, contemporary renewal. **Excellent SEO opportunity** — architecture tourism in Detroit is a growing niche, underserved online. Lower tourism volume is the drawback. Strong narrative hook ("ruin porn to renaissance").

**Savannah** — Gorgeous city with unique urban plan (Oglethorpe squares). Federal, Greek Revival, Victorian, Gothic. **Very underserved for architecture guides online** — most content is generic "pretty squares" tourism. Only 480 Commons images is a concern, but HABS covers Savannah well. Low tourism volume relative to major cities.

### Tier 3 — Lower Priority

**Pittsburgh** — Good architecture (H.H. Richardson, Fallingwater nearby, Steel-era industrial, Andy Warhol Bridge district) but limited tourism draw and small image pool.

**Seattle** — Some notable buildings (Space Needle, Central Library, Smith Tower) but not primarily an architecture destination. Mid-range everything.

**Portland OR** — Eclectic but not architecturally distinctive enough. Limited landmark density.

**Nashville** — Growing city but architecture is not its draw. Parthenon replica is fun but niche.

**Austin** — State Capitol is notable but overall architectural scene is thin for a guide.

## SEO Gap Analysis

**Best opportunities (high demand, low competition):**

1. **New Orleans** — People search for NOLA constantly but architecture-specific content is drowned out by food/music. An authoritative architecture guide would stand out.
2. **Philadelphia** — Surprising gap. Historic and diverse architecture but few dedicated online architecture guides. "Philadelphia architecture tour" has competition mainly from local walking tour companies, not content sites.
3. **Detroit** — Growing interest in "Detroit architecture" driven by ruin tourism and revival narrative. Very few comprehensive guides exist.
4. **Savannah** — Niche but passionate audience. "Savannah architecture" searches exist but content is shallow.

**Worst opportunities (saturated):**
- NYC, Chicago (already have), Boston, LA — heavily covered by existing guides.

## 🏆 RECOMMENDATION: Top 2 Cities

### 1. New York City
**Reasoning:** Despite fierce SEO competition, NYC is simply too large to ignore. It has:
- The highest search volume for architecture-related queries of any US city
- Unmatched architectural diversity (300+ years of building styles)
- Massive Reddit community for organic distribution
- Excellent image availability
- 60M+ annual tourists

The key is differentiation: focus on hidden gems, neighborhood-by-neighborhood coverage, and lesser-known buildings that existing guides skip. The sheer traffic volume means even a small % capture is significant.

### 2. New Orleans
**Reasoning:** This is the high-upside pick. New Orleans offers:
- **Unique architectural identity** unlike any other US city (French/Spanish Colonial, Creole, Shotgun, Cast-iron galleries)
- **Strong SEO gap** — architecture content is underserved vs. food/music coverage
- **High tourist volume** (18M+) with architecture-curious visitors already there
- **Photogenic and distinctive** — great for social sharing and backlinks
- **HABS has extensive coverage** compensating for moderate Commons count
- **Narrative appeal** — Creole architecture, preservation battles, post-Katrina rebuilding

New Orleans beats Philadelphia narrowly because of its more distinctive architectural identity and stronger tourism base. Philadelphia is an excellent #3 choice for a future round.

### Honorable Mentions for Future Rounds
- **Philadelphia** — Best combination of architectural richness and SEO gap
- **Detroit** — Strongest narrative hook, growing interest, very underserved
- **Washington DC** — Huge image pool, strong tourism, moderate competition
- **Savannah** — Niche but passionate audience, very underserved

## Summary

**Pick NYC and New Orleans.** NYC for maximum traffic potential and architectural breadth; New Orleans for SEO gap exploitation and unique architectural identity. Together they complement the existing portfolio well — Denver (mountain west), Den Haag (European), San Francisco (west coast), Chicago (midwest) — adding the East Coast mega-city and the South's most architecturally distinctive city.
