## cresoftware.tech — Major Rebuild
- DNS propagated to GitHub Pages (old AWS IP gone)
- Complete rebuild: G2-style product pages, rich schema (174 products), SEO infrastructure
- Product schema: feature_groups, pricing plans, pros/cons, company info, integrations, screenshots, ratings
- Homepage redesigned: clean hero, trust bar, featured tools, "What Makes This Different" section, no product dump on load
- Category pages: editorial content, "What to Look For" criteria, FAQ with JSON-LD, buyer tips (all 14 categories)
- SVG category icons replacing emojis
- Compact related tool cards (logo + name + tagline only)
- Full cards clickable, pricing hidden when no data ("Contact for pricing" removed from cards)
- Empty sections (pricing, screenshots, company) now hidden with dynamic tabs
- Submit form wired to Formspree: https://formspree.io/f/maqdjvqo
- Formspree mwvnbypg was a different/test form

## cresoftware.tech — Product Enrichment
- 30 products enriched with real scraped data: VTS, Buildout, CoStar, Dealpath, Yardi + 25 more
- Approach: scrape company websites for features/descriptions, try G2/Capterra (blocked by Cloudflare), Crunchbase (also blocked)
- Logo sourcing: best approach is scraping SVG logos from company HTML (`grep 'logo.*svg'`)
- Cost: ~$0.04/product on Sonnet, ~$0.15-0.20 on Opus
- Remaining: ~145 products still have skeleton data

## Architecture Helper
- PR #14 merged & deployed: Building detail overhaul
  - Structured JSON prompt (replaces raw HTML from GPT)
  - Redesigned show page with confidence bars, style cards, interconnected sections
  - Similar Style Buildings, Nearby Buildings, Explore This City, Explore by Style
  - Image lightbox, combined location section
  - Style pages: /styles (index) and /styles/:name (individual)
- Fixed by_style crash: missing pagination + user stats variables (pushed to main)
- Fixed style pages auth: added styles_index, style_show, by_style to public access (before_action exempt)
- Style pages were behind login wall — bad for SEO. Fixed.

## City Guide Expansion
- Wave 1 (4 cities): Washington DC, Philadelphia, Boston, Barcelona — SEO copy written, buildings selected, partial image downloads (Wikipedia rate limited)
- Wave 2 (10 cities): Bruges, Edinburgh, Kraków, Tirana, Istanbul, Rome, Detroit, Savannah, LA, Miami — SEO copy written, buildings selected, partial image downloads
- Total: 14 new cities in pipeline, ~213 buildings selected
- Blocker: Wikipedia rate limiting on image downloads. Nathan says: don't reduce resolution, use more image sources instead (Wikimedia Commons API, Flickr Commons, HABS/LOC, Unsplash)
- Blocker: Architecture Helper API submission failing (CSRF 422) — need browser-based submission
- SEO copy files saved for all 14 cities in memory/

## Google Search Console
- Nathan created service account: atlas-indexing@stoked-virtue-413221.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Project: stoked-virtue-413221
- Needs to add service account as Owner in Search Console (not Cloud IAM)
- Both cresoftware.tech and app.architecturehelper.com need the service account added
- Still need: JSON key file from Nathan to store at ~/.config/secrets/google-search-console.json
- Plan: build indexing script, auto-submit new pages, sitemap generator, periodic cron job

## Zoning Map
- Multi-select zone filter pushed to atlas dashboard zoning explorer
- Legend clicks now toggle (add/remove) instead of replace
- Selected zones shown as blue pill tags

## Nathan Preferences (confirmed today)
- Wants dashboard updated with every major update
- Don't reduce image resolution — find more sources instead
- Financial info: broad strokes helpful ("X months runway"), exact numbers unnecessary risk
- Close PR #4 (stale)

## Open Items
- Need Google Search Console JSON key from Nathan
- Retry city guide image sourcing with more sources + rate limiting
- Retry building submissions via browser instead of curl
- ~145 products still need enrichment on cresoftware.tech
- Homepage map preview still on wrong view file (from PR #11)

## Task Management System (built today)
- **tasks.json** in atlas repo — source of truth for all tasks
- Dashboard renders: Nathan action section (blocked items with steps) + task board with filters
- **Heartbeat cron (every 30min)** now:
  1. Reviews all tasks, checks if anything completed or progressed
  2. Updates statuses and progress fields
  3. Picks up ONE pending task and works on it
  4. Updates heartbeat.json + tasks.json, commits and pushes
- Task states: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked_on_nathan
- blocked_on_nathan tasks include `nathanSteps` array — exact instructions with links
- `atlasCanDo` flag distinguishes what Atlas can handle vs what needs Nathan
- `dependsOn` array for task dependencies
- Cron job ID: 3aad1143-fc00-4305-8ffd-9eac58bf4f29

## DC Building Submissions
- 4/11 submitted via browser: Capitol, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Building, National Cathedral
- Using 60s delays between submissions to avoid Heroku resource exhaustion
- Remaining 7 ready in /tmp/openclaw/uploads/
- 7 more images still need downloading (Wikipedia rate-limited)
