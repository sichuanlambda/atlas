# Architecture Helper Marketing Action Plan

## Reality Check
AH is a vitamin, not a painkiller. That's fine — it's a content brand and SEO play. Don't try to make it something it isn't.

## What's Working
- Pinterest: 10 pins, 52 impressions, 7 saves. Growing. Keep going.
- Programmatic SEO: style pages and city guides rank for long-tail queries
- Content quality: GPT-analyzed buildings are genuinely interesting and unique

## The 7 Answers
1. **Problem:** Architecture enthusiasts and travelers want to find interesting buildings to visit
2. **Audience:** Architecture enthusiasts, design students, urban travelers
3. **Current solution:** Google, Instagram, architecture blogs (fragmented, no single destination)
4. **Good/bad:** Lots of content exists but it's scattered. No "Yelp for buildings."
5. **How AH is better:** Curated, AI-analyzed, style-categorized, city-organized, one destination
6. **Pricing:** Free with premium tier (save collections, offline guides, ad-free)
7. **First 10 customers:** Pinterest + Reddit architecture communities

## Channel Strategy (Ranked by ROI)

### 1. Pinterest (Current Primary — Keep Scaling)
- 4 pins/day via cron (working)
- Expand to all cities as buildings are added
- Target: 100 pins by end of month, 500 by end of quarter
- Cross-post to style boards for 2x distribution

### 2. Programmatic SEO (High Leverage)
- Style pages: "[style] architecture" keywords (30 pages live)
- City guides: "[city] architecture guide" (9 live, 14 in pipeline)
- Building pages: "[building name] architecture analysis" (unique content moat)
- Target: 500+ indexable pages with unique content

### 3. Reddit (Low-Effort, High-Risk)
- r/architecture, r/ArchitecturePorn, r/CityPorn — share interesting building analyses
- Answer questions about architectural styles (link back naturally)
- Don't spam. Share genuinely interesting content. 1-2 posts/week max.
- Best times: Tue-Thu 10am-12pm ET

### 4. Backlinks
- Submit to architecture directories, design resource lists
- Free tool angle: "Architecture Style Identifier" (upload photo, get style analysis)
- Reach out to architecture bloggers for city guide features

### 5. Email (Later)
- Collect emails via "Save this building" or "Get the full city guide PDF"
- Weekly "Building of the Week" newsletter
- Not urgent — focus on traffic first

## Revenue Ideas
- Affiliate: link to city tours, architecture books, travel services
- Premium: save collections, offline guides, AR building viewer
- Sponsored: architects/firms featured in city guides
- Prints: sell AI-generated or curated building photography

## Don't Do
- Paid ads (wrong stage, vitamin product)
- Cold outreach (no one has this pain point urgently)
- Try to sell B2B to architecture firms (different product needed)
