# 2026-02-21 — Atlas Daily Log

### Carried Over from Feb 20 (Late Night)
- Nathan reviewing the "Explore City Architecture Guides" section on AH homepage (step1.html.erb)
- Asked to update it but hasn't specified what changes yet - waiting for direction
- Current state: basic grid of all 13 cities, no featured/hierarchy
- Working branch: /tmp/feedback-loop on fix-places branch, synced with GitHub + Heroku

### Key Context
- Place model uses `building_analyses_in_place` NOT `building_analyses` - recurring bug source
- PRs merged today: #22 (city guides on homepage), #23 (places index redesign)
- GitHub and Heroku now in sync after multiple force-pushes
- All cron jobs on Sonnet/Haiku, sub-agents on Sonnet, main session on Opus
- Compaction triggers at ~50K tokens (reserveTokensFloor=150K)
- Google Indexing API live, 49+ URLs submitted
- Dashboard analytics page built by sub-agent (cost tracking, agents & cron page)

### Pinterest Cron Failing (09:00 UTC)
- Pinterest cron tried to restart gateway to fix browser - doesn't have permission
- commands.restart=true needed in config, or cron needs different approach to browser issues
- Pins not posting - browser timeout is recurring issue
- Need to investigate: is browser actually needed? Or can we use API/web_fetch for Pinterest?

### Haiku Model Fix (10:48 UTC)
- Haiku model name was wrong: `anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5-20241022` doesn't exist
- Changed to `anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5-latest` in both config and heartbeat cron
- Heartbeat had 17 consecutive errors from the bad model name
- Fixed both gateway config + cron job (3aad1143)
