# 2026-02-21 — Atlas Daily Log

### Carried Over from Feb 20 (Late Night)
- Nathan reviewing the "Explore City Architecture Guides" section on AH homepage (step1.html.erb)
- Asked to update it but hasn't specified what changes yet - waiting for direction
- Current state: basic grid of all 13 cities, no featured/hierarchy
- Working branch: /tmp/feedback-loop on fix-places branch, synced with GitHub + Heroku

### Key Context
- Place model uses `building_analyses_in_place` NOT `building_analyses` - recurring bug source
- PRs merged today: #22 (city guides on homepage), #23 (places index redesign)
- GitHub and Heroku now in sync after multiple force-pushes
- All cron jobs on Sonnet/Haiku, sub-agents on Sonnet, main session on Opus
- Compaction triggers at ~50K tokens (reserveTokensFloor=150K)
- Google Indexing API live, 49+ URLs submitted
- Dashboard analytics page built by sub-agent (cost tracking, agents & cron page)
