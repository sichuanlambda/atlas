**Title:** I built a free architecture guide for NOLA — 14 buildings with AI style analysis, from the Pitot House to the Saenger Theatre

**Body:**
Hey y'all — I've been working on an architecture analysis tool ([Architecture Helper](https://app.architecturehelper.com/places/new-orleans)) and just finished a New Orleans guide with 14 buildings.

Not just the usual French Quarter tourist hits. Some picks that might interest y'all:

- **Pitot House** on Moss St — the only Creole colonial house open to the public in the city, and the AI nailed the West Indian influence in the gallery design
- **The shotgun house at 2726 Constance** — because you can't do NOLA architecture without a proper shotgun. The tool breaks down the Caribbean and West African building traditions behind the form
- **Bradish Johnson House** (McGehee School) on Prytania — one of the only Second Empire/mansard roof buildings in the city, designed by James Freret
- **Contemporary Arts Center** — great example of warehouse adaptive reuse in the CBD

Also has the big ones (Cathedral, Cabildo, Pontalba, Gallier Hall, Monteleone) with full style breakdowns.

The tool uses AI to identify architectural styles and influences from building images. Completely free to browse. Would love feedback from people who actually know these buildings.

What buildings am I missing that should be in the next update?

**Title:** New Orleans: 14 buildings across 8 architectural styles — how one city documents 200 years of French, Spanish, Caribbean, and American building traditions

**Body:**
I recently completed an architectural analysis of 14 New Orleans buildings for [Architecture Helper](https://app.architecturehelper.com/places/new-orleans), and the style diversity is remarkable even by American standards.

What makes NOLA architecturally unique is the *layering* — the French Quarter is paradoxically more Spanish than French (the 1788 and 1794 fires destroyed most French Colonial buildings), while the Garden District represents a completely separate Anglo-American building tradition that developed after the Louisiana Purchase.

**Styles covered:**
- **Spanish Colonial** — The Cabildo (1799), St. Louis Cathedral (1794)
- **French Colonial/West Indian** — Pitot House (1799), with its raised gallery plan directly descended from Caribbean plantation houses
- **Cast-Iron Gallery** — Pontalba Buildings (1851), the first major deployment of decorative cast iron in New Orleans
- **Greek Revival** — Gallier Hall (James Gallier Sr., 1853), Old US Mint (William Strickland, 1838)
- **Second Empire** — Bradish Johnson House (James Freret, 1872) — extremely rare in the Deep South
- **Beaux-Arts** — Hotel Monteleone (1886), NOMA (1911)
- **Atmospheric Theater** — Saenger Theatre (Emile Weil, 1927)
- **Vernacular/Shotgun** — The quintessential New Orleans housing type, with roots in West African and Haitian building traditions

The tool uses GPT-4 vision to analyze each building's architectural DNA. Each analysis page breaks down primary and secondary style influences.

Interested in feedback from the community, especially on any significant NOLA buildings I've overlooked.

**Title:** The Pontalba Buildings flanking Jackson Square, New Orleans — America's oldest apartments (1851), with their iconic cast-iron galleries [2816x2120]

**Body:**
Built by Baroness Micaela Almonester de Pontalba, these twin buildings on either side of Jackson Square were the first large-scale use of decorative cast-iron galleries in New Orleans — a style that would come to define the French Quarter's visual identity.

The buildings are a fascinating hybrid: French-inspired red brick construction with Spanish colonial courtyards and the first major ornamental cast iron in the city. The Pontalba monogram (AP) is still visible in the ironwork.
