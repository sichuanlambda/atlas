# 2026-02-18 — Atlas Daily Log

## Key Events
- PR #18 (Performance & SEO) merged & deployed by Nathan
- SSL fixed on cresoftware.tech (enabled HTTPS enforcement via GitHub API)

### Evening Session (~19:00-19:40 UTC)
- **Pinterest queue loaded**: Added 17 NYC buildings (935-952) + 2 DC buildings (954-955) to queue. Total queue now 25. Created NYC Architecture and Washington DC Architecture boards. Updated cron to auto-create boards on Pinterest when encountering new cities.
- **Philly resubmission already done!** Sub-agent successfully submitted 18 buildings (IDs 993-1011) with Wikimedia URLs. Made all visible via admin bulk action. PSFS Building (#1008) verified — real image, full GPT analysis, looks great.
- **Old Philly/Boston buildings (957-986)**: All already hidden from prior work.
- **Boston resubmission started**: Trinity Church (#1012) and Boston Public Library (#1013) submitted with Wikimedia URLs + addresses added. 2/18 complete, 16 remaining.
- **Browser issues**: VPS hit load avg 6.71 with only 187MB free RAM. Killed Chrome processes to recover (freed to 2.7GB). Browser works but stale refs cause timeouts — always re-snapshot after navigation.
- **Nathan asked about OpenClaw business models** — gave him a layered analysis (infrastructure → runtime → skills → agents → solutions) with 5 revenue models. Highlighted CRE-specific agent as natural fit given his background + existing zoning data.

### Boston Submission Progress
- Building 1: Trinity Church #1012 ✅
- Building 2: Boston Public Library #1013 ✅  
- Buildings 3-18: Still pending (Faneuil Hall through Christian Science Center)
- Using corrected flow: name + external URL → blur → click submit → add address via "Add Location"
- 60s spacing between submissions to avoid Heroku/Sidekiq overload

### Key Learnings
- Sub-agents CAN submit buildings if they use evaluate() approach (not ref-based clicks which need snapshots). The Philly sub-agent succeeded despite earlier belief it would fail.
- Always kill Chrome when done — it eats all RAM on 4GB VPS
- Stale refs are the #1 cause of "browser timeout" errors — re-snapshot after every navigation
- Dashboard: added Last Updated bar, clickable Pinterest board links, real metrics from Nathan's screenshot
- Created 6 runbooks in memory/runbooks/ for repeatable tasks
- Hetzner API token configured by Nathan in dashboard

## Building Submission Discovery
- **Root cause found**: entering an address in the form triggers Street View auto-fetch which OVERRIDES any uploaded image
- **ALL Philly buildings (957-974)** had Street View images — need resubmission
- **ALL Boston buildings (975-986)** had Street View images — need resubmission (overnight agent used address + Street View)
- **DC buildings (954-956)** — some have real images (submitted properly early on)
- **Correct flow**: submit image first (via external URL field e8) WITHOUT address, then add address via "Update Location" on the show page
- **File upload via browser automation doesn't work reliably** — headless Chrome `upload` tool sets files but `files.length` returns 0
- Documented in memory/runbooks/building-submission.md

## Building Resubmission Status
- Hid old bad Wanamaker (#968, logo image) and Eastern State (#962, tiny image)
- Compiled Wikimedia Commons URLs for all 36 Philly + Boston buildings
- Sub-agent "city-resubmit" spawned to handle bulk resubmission with corrected flow
- Test submission (#987 "Trinity Church TEST") used external URL — GPT analysis works but image shows broken on site (Wikimedia blocks hotlinking)

## Pinterest Status
- 7 pins published (all New Orleans), 7 remaining in queue
- Real metrics from Nathan's screenshot: 52 impressions, 7 saves, 5 clicks
- Pontalba Buildings leading (14 impressions) — style board cross-posting helps
- Cron posting 4x daily, working correctly
- Dashboard Pinterest section updated with real data
- Board links now clickable on dashboard

## CRE Software
- All 174 products enriched (completed overnight by sub-agents)
- SSL cert fixed — HTTPS enforcement enabled via GitHub Pages API
- Site loads correctly at https://cresoftware.tech

## Vision Docs
- Sub-agent spawned to write vision/roadmap/GTM for Architecture Helper and CRE Software
- Pending completion → will be in memory/vision-architecture-helper.md and memory/vision-cresoftware.md

## Sub-Agents Running at End of Day
- city-resubmit: hiding bad buildings + resubmitting Philly/Boston with Wikimedia URLs
- vision-docs: writing vision/roadmap docs

## Key Lesson
**Write runbooks.** Every repeatable task should have a documented procedure. Today's building submission disaster could have been avoided if the first successful DC submission had been documented step-by-step. Created 6 runbooks to prevent this going forward.
