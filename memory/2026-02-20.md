# 2026-02-20 — Atlas Daily Log

### Morning Status (09:37 UTC)
- Quiet overnight. No Nathan messages since ~22:00 UTC yesterday.
- Pinterest pin #13 posted (Preservation Hall, NOLA). 88 pins remain in queue.
- Status cron running in isolated sessions still thinks browser relay is the blocker — doesn't have context from main session work yesterday.
- Barcelona pipeline sub-agent from yesterday appears to have timed out or completed without reporting back. Need to check if any buildings were submitted.

### Key Items Carried Over from Feb 19
- Dashboard JS was broken (escaped backticks) — fixed and pushed v7 cache bust
- Content Queue page built and live at atlas/#/content
- 5 X posts ready for Nathan to post on @architectrHelpr
- 2 X post drafts for @nathansrobinson
- Nathan wants to try X API — hasn't applied yet
- Boston: 6 buildings still missing GPT analyses (#1020, #1023, #1024, #1026, #1028, #1029)
- Barcelona pipeline needs status check / re-run

### 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH: Direct DB Pipeline (10:40 UTC)
- **Eliminated Playwright browser entirely** for building submissions
- New pipeline: `heroku run -- rails runner -` with heredoc → direct DB insert + S3 upload + GPT analysis
- **Performance: 9 buildings in 30 seconds** (old: ~90s/building, sub-agents timing out at 15-20)
- Barcelona: 9 more buildings submitted (IDs 1049-1057), all images on S3, all GPT analyses completed
- Total Barcelona: 15 buildings (6 from previous sub-agent + 9 direct)
- But Barcelona city count shows 9 — previous 6 may have different city string. Need to check.
- Runbook updated to v3 (direct DB pipeline)
- Old pipeline: Research → Wikimedia API → validate images → Playwright → wait → pray
- New pipeline: Research → Wikimedia API → validate images → single heroku run → done in seconds
- **This scales to 600 buildings.** One heroku run per city, 50+ buildings per run.

### Dashboard Content Page Fixed (09:44 UTC)
- Template literals were escaped (`\${...}`) from yesterday's backtick fix
- Removed all 16 escape backslashes in renderContent function
- Pushed v8 cache bust

### TODO Today
- [x] Check Barcelona building submissions — 6 from sub-agent + 9 direct = 15
- [x] Build scalable submission pipeline — DONE, 30x faster
- [ ] Create Barcelona Place page
- [ ] Re-run GPT reanalysis for remaining Boston buildings
- [ ] Build programmatic SEO pages if Nathan approves
- [ ] Draft CRE comparison pages (VTS vs Yardi etc.)
- [ ] Check if Nathan posted any X content — track analytics
- [ ] Add new Barcelona buildings to Pinterest queue
