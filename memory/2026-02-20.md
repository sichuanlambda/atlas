# 2026-02-20 — Atlas Daily Log

### Morning Status (09:37 UTC)
- Quiet overnight. No Nathan messages since ~22:00 UTC yesterday.
- Pinterest pin #13 posted (Preservation Hall, NOLA). 88 pins remain in queue.
- Status cron running in isolated sessions still thinks browser relay is the blocker — doesn't have context from main session work yesterday.
- Barcelona pipeline sub-agent from yesterday appears to have timed out or completed without reporting back. Need to check if any buildings were submitted.

### Key Items Carried Over from Feb 19
- Dashboard JS was broken (escaped backticks) — fixed and pushed v7 cache bust
- Content Queue page built and live at atlas/#/content
- 5 X posts ready for Nathan to post on @architectrHelpr
- 2 X post drafts for @nathansrobinson
- Nathan wants to try X API — hasn't applied yet
- Boston: 6 buildings still missing GPT analyses (#1020, #1023, #1024, #1026, #1028, #1029)
- Barcelona pipeline needs status check / re-run

### 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH: Direct DB Pipeline (10:40 UTC)
- **Eliminated Playwright browser entirely** for building submissions
- New pipeline: `heroku run -- rails runner -` with heredoc → direct DB insert + S3 upload + GPT analysis
- **Performance: 9 buildings in 30 seconds** (old: ~90s/building, sub-agents timing out at 15-20)
- Barcelona: 9 more buildings submitted (IDs 1049-1057), all images on S3, all GPT analyses completed
- Total Barcelona: 15 buildings (6 from previous sub-agent + 9 direct)
- But Barcelona city count shows 9 — previous 6 may have different city string. Need to check.
- Runbook updated to v3 (direct DB pipeline)
- Old pipeline: Research → Wikimedia API → validate images → Playwright → wait → pray
- New pipeline: Research → Wikimedia API → validate images → single heroku run → done in seconds
- **This scales to 600 buildings.** One heroku run per city, 50+ buildings per run.

### Dashboard Content Page Fixed (09:44 UTC)
- Template literals were escaped (`\${...}`) from yesterday's backtick fix
- Removed all 16 escape backslashes in renderContent function
- Pushed v8 cache bust

### TODO Today
- [x] Check Barcelona building submissions — 6 from sub-agent + 9 direct = 15
- [x] Build scalable submission pipeline — DONE, 30x faster
- [ ] Create Barcelona Place page
- [ ] Re-run GPT reanalysis for remaining Boston buildings
- [ ] Build programmatic SEO pages if Nathan approves
- [ ] Draft CRE comparison pages (VTS vs Yardi etc.)
- [ ] Check if Nathan posted any X content — track analytics
- [ ] Add new Barcelona buildings to Pinterest queue

### 3 European Cities Blitz (11:00-11:30 UTC)
- **Edinburgh:** 13 buildings submitted (IDs 1058-1070), all on S3 with GPT analyses
- **Bruges:** 16 buildings submitted (IDs 1071-1086) via mason-bruges sub-agent
- **Kraków:** 17 buildings submitted (IDs 1087-1103) via mason-krakow sub-agent
- **Total: 46 buildings across 3 cities in ~30 minutes**
- All 4 Place pages created (Barcelona, Edinburgh, Bruges, Kraków) with editorial content

### visible_in_library Bug Fix (11:40 UTC)
- 77 buildings had nil `visible_in_library` — they weren't showing on Place pages
- Fixed via `update_all(visible_in_library: true)` for all Atlas-submitted buildings (user_id: 880)
- Root cause: `save!(validate: false)` skips callbacks but doesn't set default column values
- **Must always explicitly set `visible_in_library: true`** in bulk submit scripts

### Place Page Content Upgrade (11:45 UTC)
- Sub-agent wrote thorough editorial content for all 4 new cities
- Barcelona: 8,110 chars | Edinburgh: 8,823 | Bruges: 8,995 | Kraków: 9,917
- Each has h2/h3 sections: Architectural Timeline, Neighborhoods, Notable Architects, What to Notice
- Uploaded via base64 encoding through heroku run (single-quote escaping too fragile for HTML)
- **Runbook updated**: Place pages require 4000-6000+ chars, 5 sections minimum. No more thin pages.

### Typefully API Integration (11:15-12:15 UTC)
- **API key stored**: ~/.config/secrets/typefully.env (F1Wy7DwEaHHOn2l1WN9OI5lUdhkBcKMU)
- **4 social sets found**: @ArchitectrHelpr (207404), @CRESoftware (207403), @NathanSRobinson (205514), @PlotzyAI (205524)
- **Auto-post accounts**: @ArchitectrHelpr, @CRESoftware
- **Drafts only**: @NathanSRobinson (Nathan reviews), @PlotzyAI (not hooked up yet)
- **LinkedIn**: Only on Nathan's personal account. LinkedIn for Nathan + Plotzy only, NOT AH or CRE.
- **Image upload flow**: POST media/upload → get presigned S3 URL → PUT file (NO Content-Type header!) → wait 15s → use media_id
- **Scheduling**: `publish_at: "next-free-slot"` or ISO datetime or `"now"`
- **18 drafts created** across both accounts (city launches, building spotlights, style roundups, engagement, CRE promos)
- Barcelona thread (5 posts, 8 images) created and already published!

### Style Guides & Content System (12:00 UTC)
- **Social style guides**: memory/social-style-guides.md — distinct voice per account + platform
- **Content system design**: memory/content-system.md — event-driven + daily cron
- **Daily content cron**: Job 07e3b369, runs 14:00 UTC daily, creates 1 AH post + every 3rd day 1 CRE post
- **Content tracking**: memory/content-posted.json
- **Humanizer rules**: No "excited to announce", no emoji stacking, vary structure, sound human
- **Language rules**: NEVER say "GPT analysis" publicly. Use "analysis", "style analysis", "breakdown"

### Critical URL Fixes
- **Building URLs**: app.architecturehelper.com/architecture_explorer/{id} (NOT /building_analyses/ — that 404s!)
- **Domain**: app.architecturehelper.com (NOT architecturehelper.com)
- **CRE URLs**: cresoftware.tech/category.html#slug, cresoftware.tech/product.html#slug (NOT /#/category/)
- Fixed 9 AH drafts + 2 CRE drafts with wrong URLs

### Dashboard Content Hub v2 (12:30 UTC)
- Rewrote renderContent to pull from Typefully data (content-queue.json)
- Tweet-like card previews, thread support, image badges, status colors
- "Open in Typefully" links, summary cards (drafts/scheduled/published/threads/images)
- Refresh script at scripts/refresh-content-queue.sh

### Individual Building Submissions
- **Nordiska Museet** (Stockholm, #1104) — from @dutchbuildings X post
- **Hervormde Gemeente Zierikzee** (#1105) — from Nathan's photo, 1651, Zierikzee Netherlands
  - Initially misidentified as "Stadhuis van Zierikzee" built 1554 — Nathan corrected both name and date
  - Image uploaded to S3 via boto3 (new pattern: VPS → S3 directly, not through Heroku)
  - X draft queued with image on Typefully

### S3 Direct Upload from VPS (NEW)
- Can now upload to S3 directly from VPS using boto3 + Heroku config AWS creds
- Pattern: `heroku config --app boiling-atoll-02251 --json` → extract AWS keys → boto3 upload
- Faster than downloading through Heroku for local files (Nathan's photos)

### Status Cron Is Stale
- The 4x daily status cron (0f53741f) is sending outdated info (still references browser relay blocker)
- Needs to be updated or killed — it doesn't have context from main session breakthroughs

### Pinterest
- Pin #14 posted: Old U.S. Mint (NOLA) — wraps NOLA queue
- Next pin: Empire State Building (NYC) at 17:00 UTC — first NYC pin

### Current Building Count
- ~1105 total building IDs in database
- Cities with Place pages: Denver, Den Haag, SF, Chicago, NOLA, NYC, DC, Philly, Boston, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Bruges, Kraków (13 cities)
- Stockholm and Zierikzee have buildings but no Place pages yet

### Humanizer Skill (13:00 UTC)
- Installed at ~/openclaw/skills/humanizer/ and ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/humanizer/
- Shows `✓ ready` in `openclaw skills list` (source: openclaw-workspace)
- Not auto-loading in available_skills list this session (needs fresh session)
- Full SKILL.md read and integrated into social-style-guides.md
- Key patterns: kill AI vocabulary (delve, tapestry, vibrant, nestled, showcasing, testament, pivotal), no copula avoidance, no -ing fake depth, no promotional puff, add soul/opinions/varied rhythm

### CRE Software Vision Review (14:00 UTC)
- Nathan's approach: "zoom in / zoom out" — some weeks deep, many weeks backburner. Atlas runs core.
- **Priority: pSEO.** 14 buyer's guides + 42 comparison pages = 264+ rankable URLs
- Nathan wants to review one buyer's guide template before I generate all 14
- **Template written**: cresoftware.tech/guides/property-management.html (pushed to repo)
  - 7 products per guide, comparison table, TL;DR, honest tone with opinions, pros/cons, FAQ
  - Wrote 3 full reviews (Yardi, RealPage, AppFolio) to show format
  - Waiting for Nathan's feedback before generating remaining 13 guides
- **Product data enrichment needed**: 49 products have <500 char descriptions, 77 have only 1-2 feature groups
- **Revenue priority** (Nathan's input): traffic first (traffic = revenue opportunity), then paid profiles, then affiliate last
- **Reviews**: Can add review UI/functionality but no real reviews to seed. Not a priority now.
- **Category data issue**: Property Management has 53 products, some miscategorized (Alteryx, Fundrise shouldn't be there)

### Nathan's CRE Decisions
- Traffic = revenue. Don't need to monetize immediately. Just rank.
- Comparison pages: green light to go, but product data needs enriching first
- Buyer's guides: template first, then batch. Run through humanizer.
- LinkedIn is the channel for CRE (not X). CRE professionals live there.

### X Link Strategy (15:08 UTC)
- Nathan approved post tone but wants varied link approach
- X algorithm penalizes external links — most posts should NOT have direct links
- Rotation: ~40% no link, ~20% dot notation (site(dot)com), ~20% link in reply, ~20% direct link
- Updated social-style-guides.md and daily content cron (07e3b369) with this strategy
- Nathan: "looks good" on overall content quality

### CRE Buyer's Guide Template Approved (15:13 UTC)
- Nathan approved the property management buyer's guide template: "looks great, move forward"
- Sub-agent (scribe-cre-guides) spawned to generate all 13 remaining category guides
- Template at: /home/openclaw/projects/cre-directory/guides/property-management.html
- Format: TL;DR box, comparison table, 5-7 product reviews with honest pros/cons, How We Evaluated, 4 FAQs, CTA
- All guides go to /home/openclaw/projects/cre-directory/guides/{slug}.html
- Next after guides: enrich 49 thin products, then build 42 comparison pages
- Total pSEO target: 14 guides + 42 comparisons + 208 products = 264 rankable URLs

### Architecture Helper PR #21 (15:20 UTC)
- Place pages: map above tour buttons, sticky sidebar, mobile sticky bottom bar
- Branch: place-page-sticky-sidebar
- PR: https://github.com/sichuanlambda/feedback-loop/pull/21
- Waiting for Nathan to merge & deploy

### CRE Homepage Category Carousel (15:30 UTC)
- Replaced "Browse by Category" grid with card carousel (3 visible at a time on desktop)
- Cards show: icon, name, description, product count, arrow
- Navigation: prev/next buttons + dot indicators
- Responsive: 2 cards on tablet, 1 on mobile
- Removed "Independent & unbiased" from social proof bar
- Removed "Independent Reviews" trust card
- Pushed to cre-directory repo

### Content & Dashboard Requests (pending)
- Nathan wants: usage costs/model tracking on dashboard, file system visualization, content page as board/grid view (not single feed)
- Also wants: CRE homepage "Browse by Category" improvements (DONE)
- Still owe: dashboard usage + filesystem viz + content board view

### Sub-agents Running (15:30 UTC)
- scribe-cre-guides: Writing 13 buyer's guides (3 already committed)
- scout-cre-enrichment: Enriching thin product data
- scribe-underwriting-skill: Building configurable CRE underwriting skill for OpenClaw

### X Post Link Strategy (Nathan feedback, 15:08 UTC)
- Don't always include links — sometimes just content
- Rotate: 40% no link, 20% dot notation, 20% link in reply, 20% direct link
- X algorithm penalizes external links
- Updated style guide + daily content cron
