# 2026-02-22 — Atlas Daily Log

### Dashboard Full Refresh (06:02 UTC)
- **Triggered by**: Cron job c51c6094-a70d-4e78-b15f-d1dff6392ded
- **Data updated**: Real building counts from Architecture Helper database
- **Key corrections**:
  - Buildings: 592 total, 586 with images, 512 visible in library (not 553)
  - Pinterest queue: 85 pins queued (was showing 49) 
  - Cities: 13 with Place pages confirmed
  - CRE guides: 4/14 complete
- **Status**: Pinterest automation still critically broken since Feb 21 (4+ consecutive failures)
- **Highlights**: Thumbnail system from Feb 21 continues delivering 80-90% page performance improvement

### Critical Issues
- **Pinterest cron**: Complete failure since Feb 21 - Chrome extension relay needs active browser tab connection
- **Next Pinterest attempt**: 09:00 UTC (3 hours from refresh)
- **Blocking**: All social media automation until Nathan connects Chrome extension tab

### Overnight Period (22:00 Feb 21 → 06:00 Feb 22)
- Very quiet period, no activity
- No new memory files created
- No failures or alerts
- All systems stable except Pinterest automation

### Metrics Updated
- Architecture Helper: 13 cities, 592 buildings, 30 styles, 23 PRs merged
- CRE Software: 208 products, 4 buyer's guides complete  
- Pinterest: 15 published, 85 queued (100 total)
- Zoning data: 10 cities, ~120K zones
- Google Indexing: 49 URLs submitted

### Files Synced
- No new memory files since last dashboard update
- Atlas repo memory/ directory already up to date

### Dashboard Refresh #2 (09:02 UTC)
- **Pinterest cron discovery**: 09:00 UTC cron "succeeded" but failed to post pin due to browser service issues
- **Status**: Pinterest automation completely broken since Feb 20 17:00 UTC - 5th consecutive failure
- **Last successful pin**: Old U.S. Mint (Feb 20), next target still Chrysler Building (stuck since Feb 21)
- **Browser error**: "Chrome extension relay is running, but no tab is connected" or "Gateway restart is disabled"
- **Queue status**: 85 pins queued, none posted since Feb 20

### Architecture Helper Metrics Verified (09:02 UTC)
- Buildings: 592 total, 586 with images, 512 visible in library
- Cities: 13 with Place pages
- Users: 334 total
- Thumbnails: 494 generated (continuing performance benefits from Feb 21 breakthrough)

### Pinterest Performance Review (10:00 UTC) 
- **Discovery**: Pinterest performance review cron completed at 10:00 UTC
- **Issue**: Browser service unavailable, relied on last metrics from Feb 19
- **Key insights**: Cross-posting strategy works, Victorian architecture performs best, NOMA was only pin with outbound click
- **Recommendations**: Continue cross-posting, focus on Victorian/Beaux-Arts styles
- **File created**: memory/pinterest-performance.md (1574 bytes)

### Dashboard Refresh #3 (12:02 UTC)
