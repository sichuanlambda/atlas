# CRE Software Directory Marketing Action Plan

## Positioning
G2 for commercial real estate software. Helps CRE professionals pick the right tools without wading through generic review sites.

## The 7 Answers
1. **Problem:** CRE professionals waste time evaluating software — G2/Capterra don't understand CRE-specific needs
2. **Audience:** CRE operations managers, tech leads at property management firms, brokerages evaluating tools
3. **Current solution:** G2, Capterra, asking peers, Google searches
4. **Good/bad:** G2 is comprehensive but generic. No CRE-specific context on what matters for commercial real estate.
5. **How we're better:** CRE-native taxonomy, property-type filtering, CRE-specific feature comparisons, honest analysis
6. **Pricing:** Free directory. Revenue from vendor referrals and sponsored placements.
7. **First 10 "customers":** SEO traffic from "[product name] review" and "[product name] pricing" searches

## SEO Strategy (Primary Channel)

### Programmatic Pages (Highest Priority)
Each product page should rank for:
- "[product] review 2026"
- "[product] pricing"
- "[product] alternatives"
- "[product] vs [competitor]"

Total addressable keywords: 208 products × 4 keywords = 832 rankable pages

### Category Pages
- "Best [category] software for commercial real estate"
- 14 categories = 14 high-value pages
- Already have editorial content + FAQ with JSON-LD

### Comparison Pages (Build Next)
- "[Product A] vs [Product B]" — head-to-head comparisons
- Focus on top 10 most-searched matchups
- These rank extremely well on G2 and Capterra

### Blog Content
- "How to choose [category] software for your CRE firm"
- "Top 10 [category] tools for [property type]"
- "[Year] guide to CRE technology stack"

## Revenue Model
