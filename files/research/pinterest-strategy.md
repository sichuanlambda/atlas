# Pinterest Distribution Strategy for Architecture Helper

## Platform Analysis
- Pinterest is a visual discovery engine — ideal for architecture content
- 450M+ monthly active users, strong in home/design/travel verticals
- Pins have long shelf life (months vs hours on Twitter)
- SEO-friendly: pins rank in Google Image Search

## Board Strategy
### By City
- "Architecture in New Orleans"
- "Architecture in Denver"  
- "Architecture in San Francisco"
- "Architecture in Chicago"

### By Style
- "Art Deco Architecture"
- "Gothic Revival Buildings"
- "Mid-Century Modern Architecture"
- "Brutalist Architecture"

## Pin Format
- High-quality building photo (vertical 2:3 ratio preferred)
- Title: "[Building Name] — [Style] in [City]"
- Description: 2-3 sentences with keywords + link to architecturehelper.com
- Rich pins enabled via OG meta tags (already implemented in PR #8)

## Posting Cadence
- 5-10 pins/day (Pinterest favors consistent pinners)
- Spread across boards
- Mix fresh pins with repins
- Best times: evenings and weekends

## API Integration
- Pinterest API v5 supports programmatic pin creation
- Need: Pinterest Business account + API app + OAuth token
- Can batch-create pins for all 400+ buildings

## Expected Impact
- 50-200 monthly clicks within 3 months
- Compounding traffic as pin library grows
- Cross-pollination with Google Image Search rankings

## Status: Waiting on Nathan
